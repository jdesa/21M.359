Both multiplicative and additive values work. 
I personally find additive values to be more useful, just because the gradation between tempos can be really subtle and a multiplier (which compounds on the existing tempo -- making fast tempos much faster and slow tempos much slower) to be less useful for fine-tuning speed of songs.

I did think it was useful to put in existing mappings so I added a tempo increment/decrement through standard tempos (left and right arrow keys)
