##Collaboration
###############
I collaborated in class with Ben Chan. 
I worked with Kevin King and CK Ong. CK and Kevin helped give me suggestions on how to debug certain areas of my code (e.x. preventing clipping at the end of released notes by dividing by the sum of all envelopes at that time, ensuring not to remove a generator from the generator list while iterating through it, etc).
