Pset #3

Collaboration Statement: I discussed the pset with CK, Kevin, and Emily (in class)


Part 1:
	Touch Mapping: The x axis of the screen is divided into 8 parts corresponding to intervals, and the y axis is divided up into parts corresponding to octaves. These two combined provide the note mapping for this part.

Part 2:
	Note playing scheme: Similar to in part one, the various portions of the bottom of the screen are divided up into parts corresponding to given intervals.  Additionally, notes change their waveform type as they collide.

Part 3:
	I included my simple collision detection function as well as the code for my more physically accurate collision detection function (which I couldn't fully debug).

Part 4:
	Flower petals light up when played and additional flowers can be added (each new flower is added in the next key of the circle of fifths)
